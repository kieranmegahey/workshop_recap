# rock-paper-scissors-workshop

Following on from last week's hackathon, we want to refactor our rock, paper, scissors console application and turn it into an interactive HTML page.

This repo has a console rock, paper, scissors starter which you will be using for the workshop.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please remember to do all your work in this repo and **not** last week's hackathon repo.

## Task 1: DOM

Refactor your application so that all interactions are through HTML elements in your index.html file rather than via confirm, alert, and prompt. Using the DOM allows our game to be event-driven, so you may want to remove the while loop and instead compute the winner when an event is fired.

This will be deemed as complete when confirm, alert and prompt are no longer used, user interaction is handled with HTML elements, and all the information is displayed on the page.

## Task 2: Validation

Create a username input field and use the username the player inputs in the game so that a player can see their name on the page when looking at where the scores are displayed.

To make it more uniform, restrict the number of characters a username can be to 10 or fewer.

This will be deemed as complete when the users cannot enter a username longer than 10 characters.

üåü BONUS: Make it so that valid usernames should only start with letters, not numbers or symbols.
üåü EXTRA BONUS: Make it so that the first letter of the username should be capitalised.

## Task 3: Style and Animation

Use your remaining time to use CSS to add some style, flair, and animation to the playing experience on the page. Be creative! ‚ú®
