// ðŸ‘‰ Use fetch to send a GET request to https://api.kanye.rest/ and store the resolved value of the returned promise in a variable called response.

// ðŸ‘‰ Call the .json() method on the response variable to parse the JSON data contained in the response object. Store the resolved value of the returned promise in a variable called data.

// ðŸ‘‰ Use that data to set the text of the h1 with id "kanye-quote".

// ðŸ‘‰ Call this function as soon as the page loads.

// //Task 3 - History
// We're now going to display every quote we fetch in a list so that we don't forget our favorites.

// ðŸ‘‰ Create a function that takes in a string, creates a new list item with that string, and adds it to the ol with the id "kanye-quote-history".

function saveQuote(string) {
  const newLi = document.createElement("li");
  newLi.innerText = string;
  document.querySelector("#kanye-quote-history").appendChild(newLi);
}

// ðŸ‘‰ Call this function within your getQuote function so that the quotes get stored in the "kanye-quote-history" list.

// ðŸŒŸ Bonus Task!
// You might see after a while that the quotes we fetch from the API are sometimes repeated.

// ðŸ‘‰ Change your code so that if a repeat quote is generated, it will not be added to the list of previous quotes.

// ðŸŒŸ Bonus Bonus Task!
// ðŸ‘‰ Have a quote added to the history list only when a new quote is generated so that the same quote is never on the screen in two places.
