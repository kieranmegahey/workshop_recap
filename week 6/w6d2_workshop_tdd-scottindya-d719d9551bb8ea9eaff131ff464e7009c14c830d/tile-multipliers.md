# Scrabble tile multipliers

On a scrabble board there are several Premium Letter Squares that cause letter scores to be multiplied:

- Double letter score
- Triple letter score

There are also several Premium Word Squares that cause the entire word score to be multiplied:

- Double word score
- Triple word score

If a word covers more than one premium word square its score is multiplied for each of the square it covers.

A blank tile scores 0 so its placement on a premium letter square has no effect. If a blank tile is placed on a premium word square the word's score is multiplied.
