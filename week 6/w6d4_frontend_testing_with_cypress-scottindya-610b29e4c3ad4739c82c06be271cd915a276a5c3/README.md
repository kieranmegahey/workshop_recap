# Cypress

It's time to take our testing up another notch with [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress), a JavaScript testing tool for end-to-end testing.

## Part 1

As usual, the best place to start is the Getting Started section of the docs.

👉 First, follow the instructions on the [Installing Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) page to install Cypress with NPM and open it for the first time.

- Having a verification error? Use the advice on this Stack Overflow page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63667880/cypress-verification-timed-out-after-30000-milliseconds.
  
- Failing to make a connection to the Chrome DevTools? Use the advice in this Github issues comment: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6540#issuecomment-641087834.

👉 Once you have the Cypress test runner successfully open, pair with your partner through the exercises on the [Writing Your First Test](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test) page to get familiar with basic Cypress syntax and features.

## Part 2

Now that you have your bearings, go forth and test this app using Cypress! Remember, "The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you."

👉 First, have a play with the app itself, and make a plan of the behaviors you want to test with Cypress. Draft your test statements. Start with the basics, and work your way up.

👉 Then start writing the tests for each test statement you drafted. 

Remember to plan out each stage of logic within each test itself - don't start coding until you have a plan for that individual test.

- Example tests that showed up in your `cypress/integration` folder when you installed Cypress

⭐ Bonus: If you're satisfied that you've fully tested the existing app, add a feature and test it!

Ideas:

- Input validation
- Different types of input
- Different events
- Routing
- ... and more!
