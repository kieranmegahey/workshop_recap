  Clone a Site
</h1>

Now that we've spent time looking at UX, UI, and design, we'll lay down the CSS gauntlet to challenge you to clone a well-known site.

Break down the site's design, and tackle it bit by bit. Focus on creating a one-page experience, and be realistic - these sites take years to build, so get as far as you can during class and make some initial progress (although you can keep working on it afterward!).

Tips:

- When you're breaking down the website, write a plan of what you're going to do. Break down the site's design using your computational thinking - look for patterns and write a plan of how you'll tackle each part. Remember when you were breaking down websites at the beginning of the course and circling similarities.
- You can use online resources for placeholder images such as [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/) - this way, you can focus on your CSS and design first and then just swap out the image URLs later on for real images.
- We've been through how to structure CSS, naming conventions, and different tools to make layouts easier (like grid and flexbox), so remember to take advantage of everything we've learned this week.
