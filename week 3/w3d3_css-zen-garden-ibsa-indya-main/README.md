# CSS Zen Garden

Spend a little bit of time looking at the different spins people have put on the website content [here](http://www.csszengarden.com/). Use the links to each of the versions to check them out - [Mid Century Modern](http://www.csszengarden.com/221/), [Garments](http://www.csszengarden.com/220/), [Steel](http://www.csszengarden.com/219/), etc. It's the same exact HTML each time, but through the magic of CSS and UI design, people have made it look like entirely different websites!

Now it's your turn. In this repo are the same HTML and CSS files from this website, and we'd like you to put together what you've learned to put your own unique spin on it.

- Plan out your design first, and create your wireframes using a tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
- Choose your colors carefully - you can use a site like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to help.
- Remember your [visual hierarchy](https://www.awwwards.com/understanding-web-ui-visual-hierarchy.html). What do you want to stand out to a user? Use your CSS to visually prioritize accordingly.
- Keep accessibility in mind. Remember to use tools like the [Lighthouse Audit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to [help](https://medium.com/accessibility-a11y/do-an-accessibility-audit-using-google-chrome-lighthouse-30ff7887901c).

When you're finished, you can use Github Pages, Netlify, or another simple hosting solution to host your site and pop the link in Slack to show it off to the rest of the bootcamp!
