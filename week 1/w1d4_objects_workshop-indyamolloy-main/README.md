# Objects

Objects are key/value stores of information. You get the value out by knowing what key it is stored under.

## Task 1 - Declaring Objects

Create an HTML file named index.html and link this to a JS file named main.js, or work in the browser console.

Convert the following sentences into JavaScript objects.

E.G.

> My cat is black, his name is Tony and he loves cuddles.

Becomes...

```js
const myCat = {
  color: "black",
  name: "Tony",
  lovesCuddles: true,
};
```

ðŸ‘‰ Convert the rest!

> My house has 2 stories, no parking, 2 bedrooms, a garden and an energy efficiency rating of D.

> My car is red, has 4 wheels, power steering, 2 seats and does 20 miles per gallon.

> My favorite movie's title is The Dark Knight, it was released in 2008 and the lead actor is Christian Bale.

## Task 2 - Reading values

ðŸ‘‰ Copy this object into a new linked JavaScript file or script tag within html or a fresh browser console.

```js
let person = {
  name: "Ben",
  likesChocolate: true,
};
```

ðŸ‘‰ Below it write an if statement that will console.log `"Ben loves chocolate"` if likesChocolate has a value of true else console.log `"Ben hates chocolate"`. The condition for the if, and the name Ben should both be read from the object using dot notation.

ðŸ‘‰ Change the object's values and re run your code, the name and the boolean should effect how your program runs.

## Task 3 - Bracket Notation

ðŸ‘‰ Copy this object into a new linked JavaScript file or script tag within html or a fresh browser console.

```js
let desiredPleasantry = "greeting";

let bensPhrases = {
  greeting: "Well hello there!",
  farewell: "See you in another life brother",
  smallTalk: "Warm today isn't it...",
};
```

ðŸ‘‰ Use bracket notation and the `desiredPleasentry` variable to console.log Ben's greeting phrase.

ðŸ‘‰ Change what is console.log-ed by changing the value of `desiredPleasentry`.

## Task 4 - Reassigning Properties

ðŸ‘‰ Copy this object into a new linked JavaScript file or script tag within html and fill in the blank values to represent yourself, but do not touch the `isBootcamper` key, it must remain as false (just for a little bit...).

```js
let person = {
  firstName: "firstName",
  lastName: "lastName",
  isBootcamper: false,
};
```

ðŸ‘‰ Below your object, reassign the property of `isBootcamper` using the assignment operator, make it `true`!

## Task 5 - Nested Objects

```js
let communication = {
  success: true,
  payload: {
    message: {
      text: "Please send biscuits!",
      priority: "URGENT",
    },
  },
};
```

ðŸ‘‰ Using dot notation, read the text from the communication object and store in a variable.

ðŸ‘‰ If the priority is urgent, then console.log the variable, else do nothing.

## Task 6 - Get Experimental

ðŸ‘‰ Explore objects more. For example, you could...

- Create nested objects.
- Create functions that take in information and use that information to create or change objects. For example, you could make a function that took in someone's name and age and return an object for that person with those details as properties.
- Look online in documentation (for example, MDN or W3Schools) about objects in JavaScript. Can you find anything new or surprising?
