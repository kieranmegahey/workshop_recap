## JS in the console

<summary>Click me if you need a reminder of where the console is.</summary>
 To access the console, right click anywhere on the browser page and click inspect, or you can use the ctrl-shift-i keyboard shortcut on Windows or command-option-i on Mac. Then go to the tab labelled Console.

### Task 1:

1. Make a variable that is a number.

2. Read the value of that variable in your console.

3. Reassign that variable to be itself plus 50.

4. Read the value of the variable again in your console to prove that it has changed.

5. Repeat steps three and four, but use [different mathematical operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp).

## Task 2:

1. Make a variable that is a string (using `""` or `''`).

2. Using the `+` operator, reassign your variable to be what it was before, concatenated with another string.

For example, if the value of your variable is `"Hi"`, use the `+` operator so that it's reassigned to `"Hi there"`.

1. Read the value of `myString` in the console to prove to yourself that it has changed.

## Task 3:

Visit [this list of operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp) and play around in the console using all the different operators. Think of yourself as a mad scientist in a lab playing with crazy chemicals that might blow up. The only way to find out what happens is to give it a go!

Make some variables that are numbers, strings, and booleans. Have a go at building on what you've done before. Mash them together, and tear them apart. Add a string to a number, minus a number from a boolean - go mad! If anything weird happens (and it will!), make a note of what it was and why you think its happening. We can then explain it or add it to our quirk bank, and the mysteries will be revealed in time!
