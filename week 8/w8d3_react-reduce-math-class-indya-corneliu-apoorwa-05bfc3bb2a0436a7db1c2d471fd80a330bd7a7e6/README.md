# Reduce Workshop Math Class üî¢üè´

Follow the tasks in [index.js](index.js) to use the `reduce` array method to put your reduce skills through their paces. Remember, reduce reduces an array to a single value by executing a provided function for each value of the array, storing the return value after each `current` array item in the `accumulator`, which starts as your `initial value`! _(It's easy to forget, but remember to add the initial value as well as the callback function where you want your accumulator to start, or else it'll default to the first item in the array.)_

The functions you write should pass the tests. To run the tests:

- install required dependencies with `npm i`
- have a look at the `scripts` defined in `package.json` and run the script for the function you want to test. For example:
  - if you want to test your `add` function, run `npm run test1`.
  - if you want to test your `addIfTwoDigits` function, run `npm run test2`
  - and so forth.

(Running `npm t` should run all the tests for all functions with one command, which might be useful if you've finished all of the bonus questions.)
