# React Router Workshop

### **Task 1**

Read the getting started installation guide in the React Router docs -> [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/installation).

### **Task 2**

Use React Router to enable navigation between the different pages imported within the App component.

### **Bonus task**

- Dig deeper into the components you've just used on [the docs page here](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/examples/basic).
- React Router has its own hooks built into it; use [the information and examples on the docs page here](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/examples) to try out implementing them into your app.

Some hooks you may want to implement:
- [Route Objects](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/examples/route-objects)
- [Search Params](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/examples/search-params)
- [Lazy Loading](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/examples/lazy-loading)
