# Pull Requests Excercise

Some Codewars katas to practice raising and reviewing PR requests

## Workshop Outline

You task is to solve each of the katas in this repo (taken from Codewars and added in the folders here), but there's a catch...

We will be using these to practice both our git branching techniques _AND_ more importantly your PR reviewing (fun eh!? ðŸ˜„).

## Workflow

Each member of the group should create their own project (via Github classroom link).
You may need to add your group members as contributors to your repo (using the settings menu) in order to let them comment on PRs, but you should each have your own repo for your code.

You **!! MAY NOT !!** commit directly to the main branch (naughty).

**To make a code change...**

1. You will be working in groups, but _do not share code in your repo itself_ - you'll be working in individual repos at first (you obviously can talk through the problems together though).
2. Create a new branch.
3. Make your code changes. Keep it small but functional. You may not solve the whole kata with each commit, but make a plan and commit after executing each step.
4. Commit and push.
5. Raise a PR in github.
6. Share your PR URL with your group and request a code review.
7. Each other member in your group should review your code (of course you can also review it yourself first; this is good practice).
8. Read comments and implement changes if necessary.
9. Merge into main.
10. Go to step _2_, rinse and repeat.

## Optional but Good Practice

You can set up branch protection to prevent merges to main unless it has one review.
This can be found in the `settings` menu for your repo under `branches.
