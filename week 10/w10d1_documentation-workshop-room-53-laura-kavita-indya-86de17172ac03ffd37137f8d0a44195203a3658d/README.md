# Workshop - Documentation

Your task is to choose a project you or your partner have coded in the previous weeks (for scale, think hackathon or workshop rather than your week-long project!).

Write the best documentation you can for it in this README. Remember that good documentation includes (but isn't limited to!) the following:

-  Purpose - what problem is it solving?
-  What your components do and how they fit together - component tree
-  How to start it and instructions for use
-  Examples showing your software in use
-  Dependencies list and what each dependency does in your code
-  Any other information users and developers might need to know

When finished, you should be able to trade your documentation with any other group, and they should immediately be able to describe what your project does without seeing a single line of your actual code.

You can also look at docs you've referred to before for inspiration, both large (Express, React, etc.) and smaller-scale (Chalk, Nodemon, etc.).
