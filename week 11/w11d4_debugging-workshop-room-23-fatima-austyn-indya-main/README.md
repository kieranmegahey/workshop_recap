# Debugging

## Flow for each bug fix:

1. Recognise that there is bug which stops your app working as intended.
2. Investigate the code to assess where the source of the bug could be.
3. Identify the bug by running the code line by line until it is found.
4. Test fixes by changing code and re-running.
5. Fix the bug in VScode and commit change to GitHub.
6. Review the debugged code: how could you refactor the code to make it more maintainable in the future?

## No errors, but things aren't as they should be...

Using debugging tools to inspect what's going on when the app runs for the following tasks. 

Note: console logging is NOT allowed!

## Task 1

Use a debugger to fix the bugs so the correct answer is displayed (once bugs are fixed a correct answer message will appear in the console).

## Task 2

Use a debugger to investigate why the React app isn't working as expected. Write code to fix the bug.

## Task 3

Use a debugger to investigate why our Node API is not returning the correct response. Once identified, fix the bug.

## Bonus Task:

- Revisit previous or existing projects that may have bugs and use a debugger to fix them!
