# Javascript Quirks

As you work through this activity, you will be told when to do each section. Remember to work as a group throughout - share screens, and articulate as you explore.

Please don't read ahead too far and try and do things before asked to do so, or you'll spoil some of the fun!

## Task One - Truthiness

Look through the table found [here](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/), and experiment with these combinations in your console. Be ready to present some of the funny truthy / falsy things you find.

## Task Two - Abstract Equality

Have a look at the meme at the top of the article [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/explaining-the-best-javascript-meme-i-have-ever-seen/), and take a few moments in your group to try out the code in the meme before reading ahead to guess why this happens. Then continue reading, and articulate what you find out in your group. See if you can come up with some more funny examples like this.

## Task Three - Strings

Explore strings and adding or subtracting with strings in the console. See what unexpected results you can come up with, and then see if you can explain _why_ these happen.

## Task Four - typeof

Using the `typeof` function in JavaScript (check the [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) if you haven't used it before), explore some of the types of different things within JavaScript, and note any surprises you find. When you try each one, use the prototype to string call `Object.prototype.toString.call([])` where you're replacing `[]` with what you want to see what the alternative is for each one.

Prototypes are a way to access the base code in JS, and the (`toString` method)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString] allows us to view a string representing this.

Remember that I said this is basically a way of accessing the base code in JS, and we'll cover this in more depth later.

## Task Five - Numbers

Using the examples around numbers you've seen, see what else you can find out about numbers. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) article may help, as would [this one](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number). Explore and see what else you can find that might catch you out in code.

## Task Six - Math

This section is more about the use of the Math functionality than necessarily quirks, but if you find any funny ones, share them! [This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) article will help. See what you can find out about Math in your groups.

## Task Seven - Infinity

Using [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Infinity) article, explore infinity in your group. This again is about the usefulness of infinity, but you may stumble against some things that are funny, so be ready to share them!

## Task Eight - NaN

Using [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN) article, look at NaN - see what you can find out about NaN, and be ready to share.

## Task Nine - These Quotes

> Whether it's Crockford's protective albumen, or the dry and narrow minded confines of computer science classes, doctrine and dogma are the enemies of good Javascript. Some developers like rulebooks and boilerplate - which is why they have Java. The joy of Javascript is rooted in its lack of rigidity and the infinite possibilities that this allows for. Natural languages hold the same promise. The best authors and the best Javascript developers are those who obsess about language, who explore and experiment with language every day and in so doing develop their own style, their own idioms, and their own expression.

> Javascript may have its problems, but it also has the tools to solve these problems if you're willing to learn them.

> Javascript is amazing, confusing, hilarious, useful, complex and simple all at the same time - which is what makes it beautiful.

Discuss these quotes, and see if you can come up with your own quote about JS as a group.

## Task 10 - The Final One!

Using the following two quizzes, and discuss each question as a group on a shared screen before answering. Remember to record your scores for bragging rights! For the quirks masters quiz, where it asks for an email, just enter anyone's in your group.
